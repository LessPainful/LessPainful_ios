<h1>This guide explains how to setup and use LessPainful for iOS.</h1>

<p>After completing this guide you will be able to run
tests locally against the iOS Simulator. You can also
interactively explore your applications using the Ruby
irb console.</p>

<p>Finally you will be able to build your application using special "test
target" and run that on real iOS devices via
<a href="http://www.lesspainful.com/">the LessPainful service</a>.</p>

<p>This guide takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.</p>

<h2>Preparing your application.</h2>

<p>To use LessPainful for iOS in your app, you must create a new target
for your app. This target links with a couple of frameworks, as
described here.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: it is important that you create a separate target as a copy the target you usually use when distributing you app to your users. Don't link with our framework in your production app - this may cause app rejection by Apple since we are using private APIs.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Duplicate target.</p>

<ul>
<li>Select your project in XCode and select your target for your app.</li>
<li>Right click (two-finger tap) your target and select "Duplicate target"</li>
<li>Select "Duplicate only" (no transition to iPad)</li>
<li>Rename your new target from ".. copy" to "..-LP"</li>
<li>From the menu select Edit Scheme and select manage schemes.</li>
<li>Rename the Scheme from ".. copy" to "..-LP"</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Target Build Settings</p>

<ul>
<li>Click on your project and select your new "-LP" target.</li>
<li>Select "Build Settings".</li>
<li>Ensure that "All" and not "Basic" settings are selected in "build settings".</li>
<li>Find "Other Linker Flags" (you can type other link in the search field).</li>
<li>Ensure that "Other linker flags" contains: -all_load -lstdc++</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This screenshot is a reference for you build settings.</p>

<h3>Linking the test target with Frameworks:</h3>

<p>Open your application project. Expand the Frameworks folder.</p>

<p>You must link with the frameworks listed below. The easiest way is to simply drag the framework located in the <code>lib</code> folder of this project from finder to your Frameworks folder.</p>

<p>Make sure that (i) <code>Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)</code> is <em>not</em> checked and (ii) only your "-LP " target is checked in <code>Add to targets</code></p>

<p><img src="example-4.png" alt="Build settings" title="Options" /></p>

<h3>Try it out!</h3>

<p>Make sure you select your "..-LP" scheme and then run you app on 4.x/5
iPhone simulator.</p>

<p>Verify that you see console output like</p>

<pre><code>2011-11-14 21:20:00.699 Example copy[12296:18203] Creating the server: &lt;HTTPServer: 0x8995850&gt;
2011-11-14 21:20:00:703 Example copy[12296:18203] HTTPServer: Started HTTP server on port 37265
2011-11-14 21:20:01:354 Example copy[12296:1a703] Bonjour Service Published: domain(local.) type(_http._tcp.) name(iLessPainful Server)
</code></pre>

<p>You should now be able to explore your application by installing the client as described below.</p>

<p>If you are having problems don't waste time! Contact <code>karl@lesspainful.com</code> ASAP :)</p>

<h2>Installing the client.</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>You need to have Ruby 1.9.2+ installed, and a recent RubyGems
installation. I use RVM to manage my Ruby installations.</p>

<p>For RVM, see:</p>

<p><a href="http://beginrescueend.com/">http://beginrescueend.com/</a></p>

<p>You also need XCode 4.x. This guide aims at XCode 4.2, but should
also work for XCode versions >= 4.0.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Make sure ruby and ruby gems is on your path.</p>

<pre><code>krukow:~/examples$ ruby -v
ruby 1.9.2p290 (2011-07-09 revision 32553) [x86_64-darwin11.1.0]
krukow:~/examples$ gem -v
1.8.10
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Install <code>ilesspainfulclient-cucumber</code> gem version 0.1.3:</p>

<pre><code>krukow:~/examples$ gem install ilesspainfulclient-cucumber
Fetching: ilesspainfulclient-cucumber-0.1.3.gem (100%)
Successfully installed ilesspainfulclient-cucumber-0.1.3
1 gem installed...
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h2>Exploring the sample application.</h2>

<p>You can now explore the sample application:</p>

<p>Let's say you've extracted the zip file into a working
directory, examples.</p>

<p>Open the XCode project: LPSimpleExample.xcodeproj using XCode.</p>

<p>Select the LPSimpleExample-LP and iPhone Simulator 4.3/5.0 scheme
under schemes.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/LessPainful/LessPainful_ios/raw/master/documentation/example-1.png" alt="Selecting the right scheme" title="Selecting Scheme" /></p>

<h3>Run it</h3>

<p>CMD-R to run. Look at the log output and verify that you see:</p>

<pre><code>LPSimpleExample[11298:13703] HTTPServer: Started HTTP server on port 37265
</code></pre>

<p>If that message is there, you're good to go.</p>

<h3>Play with it</h3>

<p>Now start the Ruby irb using the following command.</p>

<pre><code>krukow:~/examples$ STEP_PAUSE=2 OS=ios4 DEVICE=iphone DEVICE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:37265 irb
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you're running on iOS4.x you must write <code>OS=ios4</code> and if
you're running iOS 5.x, write <code>OS=ios5</code>.</p>

<p>In the irb first require:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-1.9.2-p290 :001 &gt; require 'ilesspainfulclient-cucumber/operations'
=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>Then include</p>

<pre><code>ruby-1.9.2-p290 :002 &gt; include ILessPainfulClient::Cucumber::Operations
=&gt; Object
</code></pre>

<p>From this console you can explore your application interactively.</p>

<p>You can query, touch, scroll, etc from the irb session.
For example, notice that the sample app has a button: "Login".</p>

<h3>Query</h3>

<p>Now try this from the irb:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-1.9.2-p290 :003 &gt; query("button")
</code></pre>

<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>=&gt; ["&lt;UIRoundedRectButton: 0x6567e00; frame = (109 215; 73 37); opaque = NO; autoresize = RM+BM; layer = &lt;CALayer: 0x6567ef0&gt;&gt;"]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>query</code> function takes a string query as an argument. They query argument is similar to a css selector, for example we can do:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-1.9.2-p290 :009 &gt; query("button label")
 =&gt; ["&lt;UIButtonLabel: 0x6624f40; frame = (16 9; 40 19); text = 'Login'; clipsToBounds = YES; opaque = NO; userInteractionEnabled = NO; layer = &lt;CALayer: 0x6645ec0&gt;&gt;"]
</code></pre>

<p>It may also take parameters that are mapped to Objective-C selectors on the found object.</p>

<pre><code>ruby-1.9.2-p290 :010 &gt; query("button label", :text)
=&gt; ["Login"]
</code></pre>

<h3>Touch</h3>

<p>Anything that can be found using query can also be touched.
Try this while you watch the iOS Simulator:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-1.9.2-p290 :011 &gt; touch("button")
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the button is touched (turns blue), although this button doesn't do anything.</p>

<p>You can also touch the tab bars:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-1.9.2-p290 :016 &gt; touch("tabBarButton index:1")
</code></pre>

<p>The filter: <code>index:1</code> means that it is the second tab-bar button that should be touched.</p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

<p>In general UI views are found using accesibility labels. To use those in the simulator they must be enabled.</p>

<ul>
<li>Press the "home-screen" button in the iOS Simulator</li>
<li>Scroll left and open the Settings app insied iOS Simulator</li>
<li>Select <code>General</code> > <code>Accessibility</code> > <code>Accessibility Inspector</code> : On.</li>
<li>Re-run the sample app from XCode.</li>
</ul>

<p>In your irb session try this:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-1.9.2-p290 :025 &gt; query("view marked:'switch'")
</code></pre>

<p>This command finds a view with accessibility label 'switch' (not that we use single quotes to delimit the accessibility label.</p>

<p>In general, many views have accessibility labels that "make sense". For example the tab bar buttons have accessibility labels:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-1.9.2-p290 :029 &gt; touch("tabBarButton marked:'second'")
</code></pre>

<p>To control accessibility labels on your views use:
<code>isAccessibilityElement = YES, and accessibilityLabel = @"somelbl";</code> This can be done in interface builder or programmatically:</p>

<pre><code>    (void) viewDidLoad {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        self.uiswitch.isAccessibilityElement = YES;
        self.uiswitch.accessibilityLabel = @"switch";
    }
</code></pre>

<h3>Advanced commands</h3>

<p>Surprisingly, these commands are enough to navigate fairly many iOS apps. However, there are many more commands available. Consult the file GherkinAPI.txt for examples of how to use these.</p>

<h3>Writing tests.</h3>

<p>Test are run using Cucumber and written in a special particularly readable language: Gherkin.</p>

<p>In your project directory you can run the following command to setup a test directory.</p>

<pre><code>krukow:~/examples/Example/Example$ ilesspainful-skeleton
...
</code></pre>

<p>This generates a features directory containing a single test that
simply takes a screenshot. Alternatively, you can create the directory
by copying that of the LPSimpleExample.</p>

<p>Try running it with cucumber (<code>OS=ios5</code> if running iOS 5).</p>

<pre><code>krukow:~/examples/Example/Example$ STEP_PAUSE=2 OS=ios4 DEVICE=iphone DEVICE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:37265 cucumber
Feature:
    As an iOS developer
    I want to have a sample feature file
    So I can begin testing quickly

Scenario: Example steps    # features/my_first.feature:6
    Given the app is running # ilesspainfulclient-cucumber-0.1.3/lib/ilesspainfulclient-cucumber/lesspainful_steps.rb:6
    Then take picture        # ilesspainfulclient-cucumber-0.1.3/lib/ilesspainfulclient-cucumber/lesspainful_steps.rb:155

1 scenario (1 passed)
2 steps (2 passed)
0m2.366s
</code></pre>

<p>To see what steps are available and how they are implemented using the Ruby API see the file GherkinAPI.txt</p>
